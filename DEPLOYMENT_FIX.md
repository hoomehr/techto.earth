# Deployment Fix for Blog Pages

This document describes the changes made to resolve deployment errors with the blog pages in TechTo.Earth.

## Issue Description

During deployment, the following error occurred when building the blog page:

```
Error occurred prerendering page "/blog". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error
TypeError: e.from is not a function
```

This is a common error that occurs when:
1. There's an issue with data handling in a component
2. A problem occurs during the static site generation (SSG) process
3. The database schema doesn't match what the code expects

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Added Defensive Programming

The blog pages were updated to include:
- Proper null/undefined checks on all data
- Safe array handling with `Array.isArray()` checks
- Fallback values for missing data
- Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Fallback UI components when data is unavailable

### 2. Simplified Data Queries

- Reduced complex joined queries to simpler flat queries
- Used explicit field selection instead of "*" selectors
- Added fallback empty arrays for data results
- Properly awaited Supabase client creation

### 3. Created Database Setup Scripts

Added a new script `scripts/setup-blog-tables.js` that:
- Creates the necessary blog tables if they don't exist
- Uses a consistent schema across environments
- Provides proper relationships between tables

### 4. Added Documentation

Created documentation files:
- `BLOG_SETUP.md`: Instructions for setting up and using the blog
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`: This document explaining the fix

### 5. Implemented Alternative Query Methods

In category pages, added a fallback mechanism to get posts:
1. First tries using the `contains` operator on a categories field
2. If that fails, falls back to using the junction table relationship

## Modified Files

1. `app/blog/page.tsx` - Simplified data handling
2. `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added error handling
3. `app/blog/category/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added alternative query approaches
4. `lib/image-utils.ts` - Fixed type issues and added better null handling
5. `scripts/setup-blog-tables.js` - Created new database migration script

## Future Recommendations

1. Add a function in Supabase to check if a blog table exists and create it if missing
2. Implement proper database migrations for schema changes
3. Use TypeScript interfaces for all database types
4. Add more comprehensive error logging to debug issues
5. Implement feature flags to disable features if they're not properly set up
